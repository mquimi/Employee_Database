Working with SQL

### Overview

This weeks analysis was conducted using SQL queries in order to create different list of retiring employees. More specifically we want to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

### Results

- If you look at the image above you see the total amount of employees with each title. Since PH is focusing on their employees who will be retiring soon, based on the list Senior Engineer is the most retiring position. Based on this information, PH can plan ahead on how many Seniors Engineers will be leaving.

- The list above is also beneficial for the company to view because it gives you an idea of what roles need more people or what roles need less people.

Two observations that can be made based on the image above are:

- This list can be used to create the mentors for the mentorship program by seeing who has the experience to make the program effective. For example, we can see that Christian Koblick was an Engineer from 1986-1995 and from 1995 to the present time was promoted to Senior Engineer. 

- The list below is also a good analysis of employees who could possibly be promoted for future positions based on their previous titles. For example Mary has been a staff memeber, but seems like she has not been promoted to any other position. With this information, the company can consider Mary for an openings.


### Summary

In conclusion, PH has to look into hiring new employees as 64% of the workforce is apart of the retirement age (57,668/90,398 = 64%). If we look at the numbers, their will not be enough employees to manage the tasks that Senior Engineers or Senior Staff do. The good thing about PH is that if they focus thier enegery on trianing the positions of Engineer and Staff, in the future these employees can be quickly promoted and they will know the ins and out of PH.
